# Adnan Kattekaden (Indie Dev)

### About Me

>Hi, I'm a self-taught developer with over 2 years of hands-on experience in Python and Django. During my journey, I've had the opportunity to work with various NGOs such as Pygrammers and Gtech Mulearn. I started off as a beginner admin for Telegram and WhatsApp communities, which eventually led to community management.

Additionally, I've been part of conducting various tech events and have given sessions to college students about basic Python and Pygame. While working with NGOs, I also got the opportunity to work with open source contributions, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I'm passionate about working on open source projects and aspire to learn and explore more languages in the future.

Apart from my interest in tech, I also enjoy building cool products at nights and weekends, which I call indie products or indie development. In the long run, I aspire to be an entrepreneur and make changes in Kerala's education sector.

Overall, I've learned a lot through my self-taught journey and have enjoyed every step of the way. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the tech industry.
