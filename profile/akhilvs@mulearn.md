#### As a Top 100 Member: 

Programming is a never ending learning process and we need to update ourself regularly to keep up with the trend. There will be something which I can learn from here. 
Also those people here are all ready to take challanges and want to advance in their career. Connections like that is always the best in a Programming industry. And it will help me to showcase my skills in front of the recruiters and professionals as getting an interview is really difficult for me than cracking the interview because of my Mechanical Engineering background.

#### Career Plan: 

My short term goal is to excell as a Software Engineer. I want to become a full stack developer by completing the Python course I enrolled in. My long term goal is to become an entrepreneur. 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala's Tech ecosystem is growing really fast but still needs to take care of small challenges like:
We have strong technology ecosystem infrastructure, but transportation remains a challenge. 
We are losing talented people to MNCs. We should recruit those people so that they can make quality applications for the public.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

I have a package in pub.dev called Shopify_storefront. Other open souce applications include Netflix app clone in various statemanagement solutions like GetX, Provider, etc, Bloc application with and without freezed etc. All these applications are made for Flutter freshers to start learning on a codebase.

#### History of Community Engagement:

I am active on Linkedin and most of the time I answer questions there. I have a stack overflow account and I only answer questions if there is no real answer there or the answer is incorrect.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

There is none at this moment

#### Highly Used Software Tools:
