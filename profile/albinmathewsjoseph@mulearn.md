### About Me

I call myself ALMAJOO. I'm an aspiring software developer and a wannabe Stand-up comedian. I'm a recent Computer Science and Engineering Graduate from College of Engineering Aranmula, Pathanamthitta. I am currently working in an IT firm as a Solution Engineer(aka the guy providing solutions to most problems) specializing in Full-Stack Development using React and Springboot.

I was a volunteering junkie during my undergraduate years. Even though our college was small, I and my batchmates were able to introduce our college to many organizations and communities such as IEEE, IETE, IEDC, Tinkerhub, GTech Mulearn, and so on. We were able to introduce our college to a vast array of opportunities which helped our fellow college mates and above all, us.

Almajoo was not a "techie" in his college life, but to survive in the world, he made the best of his opportunities and started to develop his coding skills. That experience led him to the understanding that he can code (Happie momentüòÅ). This made him self-confident enough to take basic Java lessons for beginners(Humble Bragüòá). He is right now fascinated by blockchain technology and is planning to build 'something' using it.
