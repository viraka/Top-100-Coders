### About Me

> A developer who likes to write code as a hobby and profession. I have been doing hobby scripting since 8th grade, but most of my more serious code was written after my junior college year. I try to experiment with almost everything I get interested on, so I have a lot of tools and software that I have used before. I like to experiment with new technologies as much as I can, so that when I actually need to use something, I know where I can reach out to. I was also able to volunteer and intern for some major organizations recently as well. I primarily develop in TypeScript, but Rust has been a favorite for me recently as well. I have also used Lua, C, C#, etc for minor use cases. Check out my GitHub [here](https://github.com/arjunindia).

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As a tech enthusiast, I'm really looking forward to be a part of the Top 100. 
- This opportunity will allow me to connect, learn, and grow alongside some of the brightest minds from Kerala.
- This new venture is a stepping stone for me to enhance my skills and collaborate with a team to explore some fresh new possiblities.
- I look forward to be able to learn new things and teach new things!

#### Career Plan:

- As an open-source enthusiast I like to be able to maintain and contribute to open source projects that directly help startups build great products.
- In the long term I wish to be a part of a startup myself, especially if the product or service they offer fall into FOSS.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala fosters a great startup ecosystem, especially recently which has proven that Kerala can be a huge hub for startups in general.
- But a lot of startups miss out on giving back to the community. Even if unsuccessful, a startup becomes much more useful to others in this field in this way. 
- Fostering Open Source is one of such things that we can learn from startups across the world.
