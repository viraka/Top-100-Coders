# Ashwin A Murali 

### About Me

> I am Ashwin A Murali, a 3rd year B.Tech student at Marian Engineering College Thiruvananthapuram.I am a full stack developer and a Machine Learning enthusiast. I am a self taught programmer and have been coding for the past 3 years. I am a tech enthusiast and a person who love to explore new technologies. From time to time I would work on some competitive coding questions on leetcode. I am also interested in Ethical Hacking. I am the CMO of the IEDC ececom of our campus.


### Portfolio Highlights



#### Leadership and Influence: 

- Leaded a group of 4 for developing a blood bank system for our school project in 12th grade.

- Since I am the CMO of our IEDC, I constantly have to take lead and influence others to do their work, and managing the team.

- Me along with 1 other team member has a team of 6 people working under us for creative and design works in our IEDC.

#### Networking: 

- As a member of IEDC, networking is a key. I have to network with other IEDC's and other people in the industry for marketing purposes.

- And being part of many such communities, I could attend many events and meet many like minded people. I like to attend such events and meet new people.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- I like competitive coding, but there weren't such opportunities in my college and also there werent many people who were interested in it. So I thought this would be a great opportunity to meet like minded people and also to learn from them.

- I am currently working on Full Stack Development and I am learning Machine Learning as my second priority. But now I could collaborate and work with many people who are interested in competitive coding which I allways wanted to do.

- I am sure that being in the top 100 would boost my skills and my mental capabilities by many folds so being part of it benifiting my career is a tautology.

#### Career Plan: 

- As for my immediate plans, it would be learning as much stuff as I can and build my portfolio. I like working on Full Stack and Machine Learning, so more learning on that.

- If time allows, I would also like to learn Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security since they are much important in todays society. I want to help people from cyber attacks. Many people I know were victims of cyber attacks and at that time I felt helpless. So I want to learn it and help people.

- As for my long term goals, it is not yet fixed. I am still exploring my options. But I am sure that I would be working in the tech industry.

- Talking about my thoughts, Kerala is blessed with some really awesome minds, but the only problem is that they are not steping forward. Being part of IEDC, I know that there are many opportunities and many people who are willing to help. So I am sure that within the next 5 years, Kerala would be a major player in the tech industry.

- And communities like this would help many people in realizing their full pottential which would in turn help us to excel in the tech startup ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

- With the help of many communities like this, I am sure that Kerala could excel in the tech startup ecosystem for the future.

- By conducting more events like this many people could be motivated to step forward and maybe think of some real innovative ideas.

- I believe that if a person is constantly motivated by people, ideas and startups, he/she would sure come up with some innovative ideas.

- Getting inspired makes us want to reach the same level as the person who inspired us. So I believe that if we could inspire more people, we could have more innovative ideas.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Currently I don't have any contribution to open source projects, but I am planning to contribute to some projects in the near future.

- Other than that I have contributed to some projects with my friends in college as well as in school.
