### About Me

> I am a 20-year-old self-taught full-stack web developer hailing from the picturesque state of Kerala, India. Currently, I am working as a MERN Stack Developer at Quantorix Technologies Pvt Ltd, where I strive to contribute innovative solutions in web development. My journey into the tech world started early; at the age of 16, I began freelancing and delivering software, demonstrating a natural talent and passion for technology. Unlike most, I took the unconventional route by dropping out after my +2 education to immerse myself completely in the IT sector. This decision has allowed me to explore my passions more fully and to focus on what I truly enjoy.
But my involvement with technology doesnâ€™t end at work. I am also a highly passionate tech enthusiast and take great pleasure in mentoring beginners in various fields such as software engineering, IT career planning, and personal development. My enthusiasm is not just confined to my professional life; I aspire to make a lasting impact on society by leveraging technology for social good. My motto is to always keep learning and to use my skills and knowledge to inspire and help others. I firmly believe that technology, when harnessed correctly, has the power to revolutionize our world for the better, and I am committed to being part of that change.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- I want to join the Top 100 program because it fits well with my job as a MERN Stack Developer. I love tech and working with others in the field, and this program is a great place to meet people who think like me. Being in the Top 100 would help me a lot in my career.
If I get into the Top 100, more people will know who I am, and that could lead to new work opportunities and collaborations. It will also help me learn new things and stay up-to-date with what's going on in the tech world. Plus, I'll get the chance to be mentored by experts, which will make me even better at my work.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

- Kerala have great-minded and smart people so, we should have a good system to teach students technology and create an ability to blend them with real life.
- The government could make it easier for startups by cutting down on paperwork and giving them some tax breaks or grants.
- If Kerala can mix technology education, government support, and its own strengths, it has a really good chance to become a leader in the tech startup scene.
- Support more open source
