### About Me

> I am an 9th Standard Student. Programming is my biggest interest. I started self-teaching programming over 2.5 years ago, and I actually started Developing Discord bots with Python by the end of 2021. Over the course of the next year I gained expertise in Web Development. I mostly make Websites and Web APIs with `PHP` and `MySQL` I am also interested in Desktop app development. I also have an understanding of Low-Level Programming. I am Proeffient in `HTML`, `CSS`, `PHP` and `Python`. I know to write `Java` and `JavaScript`. I am currently learning `C`, and `Assembly` is on my bucket-list. I have built Several Applications on a small level. I want to learn to build an OS.
