# Muhammed Zafar MM (Backend Developer & AI Enthusiasts)

### About Me

> Based in Kerala, Thalassery, I am Muhammed Zafar MM, a Backend Developer and Team Lead at GTech Mulearn. Throughout my career, I've transitioned through diverse roles, from web development to AI leadership, mastering Django, Python, and Artificial Intelligence. Beyond my professional journey at GTech Mulearn, I proudly represented IEDC KMCTCE as a Community Lead and Tinkerhub KMTCE as a Campus Ambassador, honing my leadership and event coordination skills. Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from KMCTCE, Kerala Technological University. With a keen interest in puzzles, programming, and chess, I continually blend my technical expertise with an unwavering passion for learning and team collaboration.


### Portfolio Highlights



#### Leadership and Influence:

Throughout my college days and my early professional stints, I've been fortunate to have roles that allowed me to take initiative, work with diverse groups, and make impactful decisions.

- Campus Communities: My involvement with IEDC KMCTCE, μLearn KMCTCE, and Tinkerhub KMCTCE wasn't just as a member. I took active roles in planning, organizing, and executing events. These weren't always easy tasks. Juggling schedules, ensuring everyone was on the same page, and sometimes troubleshooting last-minute issues gave me firsthand leadership experiences. It was a balance of learning on the go and applying what I knew.

- Internship at μLearn: At μLearn, I took on multiple roles – leading the backend development and co-leading the AI Interest Group. Working as a team lead was a great experience; from guiding the team on technical aspects to ensuring project timelines were met. As a co-lead for the AI Interest Group, I had the chance to collaborate with some talented individuals and connect with some knowledgable mentors. Together, we organized AI-focused events and courses, aiming to make AI more approachable and interesting for everyone.


These roles might seem varied, but the common thread was the opportunity to step up, take charge, and grow as a leader – all while learning from those around me.


#### Networking:

Networking has always been about genuine connections for me, rather than just a numbers game. Here's how I approach it and how I intend to engage with the Top 100 community:

- Building Authentic Relationships: Over the years, whether it was through college groups like IEDC KMCTCE and Tinkerhub KMCTCE, or during my professional stint at μLearn, I always prioritized building genuine relationships. It wasn't about just adding contacts but about truly understanding the strengths, passions, and goals of those I connected with. This has allowed me to foster great, mutually beneficial relationships.

- Engaging with the Top 100 Community: I'm excited about the prospect of joining the Top 100 community. My plan is to start by actively participating in discussions, sharing my experiences, and learning from the vast knowledge pool that the community offers. I believe in the power of collaboration, so I'll seek out opportunities to collaborate on projects or brainstorm on ideas that can drive our field forward.

- Influence and Leadership: My approach to leadership has always been grounded in shared learning and growth. Within the Top 100 community, I hope to organize webinars or workshops, leveraging my experience in backend development and AI. Sharing knowledge & creating discussions to understand different views are ways I intend to lead and influence.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

Joining the Top 100 has been something I've thought about deeply. Here's how I feel it aligns with my current profession and how it could shape my path forward:

- Learning from the Best: In my current role as a Backend Developer Team Lead at GTech Mulearn, I've had a wonderful journey of growth. But I believe there's always more to learn. The Top 100 brings together some incredibly talented individuals, and I'm eager to learn from their experiences and insights.

- Expanding My Understanding: While I've been fortunate to delve into backend development and AI, I know there's a vast world of tech out there. I see the Top 100 as a chance to get a broader understanding, hear about the latest trends, and discover how different tech domains intertwine.

- For My Career Path: I've always believed that growth comes from stepping out of one's comfort zone. Being a part of the Top 100 could offer new challenges, introduce me to new collaborators, and perhaps help me shape my career in ways I haven't even imagined yet.

In essence, I view the Top 100 as a wonderful opportunity not just to share what I know, but more importantly, to absorb, learn, and grow with a community that's as passionate about tech as I am.



#### Career Plan:

Kerala's startup scene is full of opportunities. Here's how I see myself helping it grow:

Immediate plans:

- Sharing What I Know: With my background at GTech Mulearn, IEDC, and Tinkerhub, I want to set up practical workshops for young tech minds in Kerala. It's all about giving them both tech skills and a peek into the startup world.

- Building Connections: We need to get startups, schools, and big tech companies talking. This way the profesionals can directly connect with talented individuals

Long term plans:

- Guiding New Startups: Everyone benefits from a helping hand. I dream of a setup where experienced professionals in the field to give guidance to the new startups in Kerala.

- Pushing for Innovation: There's so much talent in Kerala. I see places or hubs where this talent gets the right tools and space to create cool tech stuff for our challenges, both here and worldwide.

On Kerala's Tech Future:

Kerala has everything it needs to shine in the tech startup world. We just need to focus on teaching creativity, making a friendly business setup, and ensuring startups have funds to kick off. If we also create an environment where taking chances and learning from ups and downs is the norm, Kerala could be a big name in the global startup story.

In short, I believe Kerala's on the edge of a tech breakthrough, and together, we can make that jump.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

There's something I always believed in, "Nothing you consider glorified and desiring would ever come easy, because if it did it wouldn't be so desired", now I am not sure how much truth is in that statement but the Kerala's tech scene has always struck me as a sleeping giant, teeming with untapped potential, with students scared to take the first step. Here's how I think we can take it to the next level:

- Education and Training: First and foremost, we need to prioritize tech and entrepreneurial education right from the school level. Workshops, boot camps, and courses tailored to modern tech trends can equip our youth with the tools they need to innovate.

- Funding and Support: Startups thrive when they have the right backing. Setting up more incubators, accelerators, and connecting local startups with investors can make a world of difference.

- Promote Collaboration: It's crucial to bridge the gap between established IT giants, budding startups, and academia. Regular networking events, hackathons, and collaborative projects can drive this synergy.

- Celebrate Success and Learn from Failures: The journey of a startup is riddled with highs and lows. We need a culture that not only celebrates victories but also views failures as valuable lessons. A supportive environment can encourage more individuals to take entrepreneurial leaps.

- Friendly Policies: Simplifying business regulations and offering tax breaks or incentives can make Kerala an attractive hub for tech startups from all over the country, even globally.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

Though I've passionately developed tools such as DataForge, Clickery, and hosted them on GitHub with an MIT license, they are yet to gain significant widespread usage. These tools were created out of my genuine interest in solving specific problems and have served as invaluable learning experiences. Even though they haven't reached a broad audience, I believe in their utility and am continuously looking for ways to enhance and promote them. It's my hope that as I continue to refine and expand on these tools, they will find a wider user base in the future.

Given the rigorous and comprehensive nature of these courses, I've chosen to invest a significant amount of my time and energy into them, ensuring I grasp each concept thoroughly.

While I recognize the value of platforms like Exercism, HackerRank, and Kaggle for hands-on challenges and real-world problem-solving, I've currently chosen to prioritize structured learning through CS50. However, I am open to exploring these competitive platforms in the near future, once I feel confident in my foundational understanding from the courses I'm currently undertaking.
