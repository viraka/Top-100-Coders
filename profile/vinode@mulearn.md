# VINOD E

## About Me
Hai, this is Vinod, I'm a polytechnic teacher. 
Though I belong to Ernakulam, I'm currently working in "the cool & beautiful" Wayanad district. 
Before starting this career, I was a programmer in KELTEC, Thiruvananthapuram.

I'm a post graduate in Computer Science. I always wanted to pursue a career in a tech firm. I had
enjoyed my programming job very much, but due to the pressure from my family to relocate, I left
that and preferred the present one.

Now, being a teacher I'm doing a lot to mould my students to attain their dreams. I strongly believe 
that Mulearn can help them. My decision to participate in "Top 100 Coders" event is also to motivate 
my students. Thanks for this opportunity.

## Portfolio Heighlights

#### Leadership and Influence:
Whether it is a kindergarten or a higher education institution, teachers are leaders and influencers. 
My students also have the same expectations. I believe I am such a leader. More than imparting knowledge
and skills, I inspire and motivate them. I always encourage them to achieve their dreams. I have seen 
students facing many difficulties. In such situations, I have given support and guidance which equipped
them overcome challenges. 

#### Networking:
In my openion, effective networking skills not only enhance a person's ability to work within a team but 
also contribute to personal and career growth in the field. Though I'm not a good communicator, I'm an 
active listener. Listening carefully to colleagues' ideas and concerns can promote understanding and 
productive discussions within the team. It will help me in understanding the perspectives of others. 
I hope, this will intern help me in collaborating with others in my field. 

#### As a Top 100 Member:
This is the first big event I heard about after joining Mulearn last week. I still wonder about the process
of selecting the Top 100 Coders from the thousands of participants. I just want to know about the hurdles they 
need to overcome to be included in the list. I hope, by personally experiencing it I can guide and prepare 
my students to participate in such future events. Moreover I have some flair for coding too.

Being in Top 100 will be a great surprise for me since I am a person who is unfamiliar with most of the latest
software tools and platforms. I'm sure it won't happen. At present a Top 100 Coder status will not benefit
to my career. But it will boost my energy to learn new things.

#### Career Plan:
Technology startups have a very bright future. Talented professionals are the backbones of such ventures.
Technical institutions like Polytechnics and Engineering colleges are striving hard to ensure a steady supply 
of talented professions. If the industry also collaborates with these technical institutions, their job will 
be easier.

My contribution to the state's Technology Starup Ecosyetem is as a teacher in a polytechnic college which produces
talented and competitive youth suitable for the industry. Recently I have introduced Mulearn to my students. Many
of them are interested in it and have started learning with it. I hope with the help of Mulearn they will become
more suitable for the industry either as an employee or as an enterpreneur.

#### Thoughts on Keralas's Tech Ecosystem:
For Kerala to excel Technology Startup Ecosytem, more enterprenuers should come up in the fields of tourism, health
care, agriculture, electric/solar vehicles etc. Compared to the time before 2020, now more demands have arised in these 
areas. We should be able to tap those opportunities and provide people with technological support and service in 
these areas. Startups in these fields will have great future.
