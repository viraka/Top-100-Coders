# Full Name 

### About Me

> Computer Science Engineering student, passionate about technology and programming. I am currenlty working as a full stack engineer at an edtech startup, Blend-ed. Curious about problem solving mainly through competitive programming and automating personal tasks. Currently working on AI/ML, Automation and CI/CD
If someone asks about what got you into programming, I'd always tell the magic words which my mother told when I was addicted to video games, that brought all my likes into Computer and technology and I quote "Learn and explore now, then you could sit all day infront of your laptop!"
Interested in sharing experiences and making new connections from people around the globe.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
